# Team Contract

## Communication

1. **Team Meetings** 
	We will use the when2meet website to determine our availability, then schedule meetings three to four days a week. Each meeting should last a couple hours, depending on the day. We should be meeting face-to-face unless mitigating circumstances arise, in which case we will use Discord to host a meeting. Every member should be taking notes as every member would be taking on a task.

2. **Assistance** 
	Our group currently uses Discord as our main source of communication. It is user friendly and provides a great way to communicate with others.  We will expect response times from team members to vary from 0 mins to 1 day.

3. **Respect** 
	We will be building a collaborative environment where everyone is able to bring in their own opinions and have them discussed and taken into consideration. This will be ensured through written communication and idea brainstorming. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
	Our team decided on working on the same algorithm one at a time, but each subpart of that algorithm would be split up between each member of the team. If our team members need help and we are working remotely, we would contact each other through discord. Otherwise, if we are meeting in person, we would collaborate as a team to resolve the current issue. The subparts would essentially be distributed based on personal choice and time. If one of our members communicates that they will be swamped with assignments, their workload will be much less. After finishing the one algorithm, we would move on to the next.

5. **Time Commitment** 
	Every member would be expected to spend three to five hours per week on the project. Our team decided on meeting 3-4 times a week. The current plan is to meet on Saturday, Sunday, and 1-2 available weekdays, which will be flexible depending on the needs of members. If we decide to meet extra days, it will be effectively communicated through Discord. If there are unexpected occurrences where members have less time to work on their part of the project, we would redistribute the workload by lessening their part.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
	If a disagreement arises, we will find a compromise or an encompassing solution. If there is no effective compromise, we can take a vote. If the vote is evenly split, we will play Smash as a means of increasing teamwork and coordination. The winner will serve as the tie breaking vote. When team members do not accomplish their tasks, we would issue an ultimatum where he would essentially create another proposal of when he will get the task done by. If a team member is late to complete a task, then working overtime would be prioritized. If the issue does not get reasonably resolved, then we would inform course staff for their intervention or assistance.
